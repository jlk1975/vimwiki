== Ideas == 
* Maybe just use VimWiki for a [[https://yatsushi.com/blog/vim-as-a-journal| Daily journal]]there would be no reason to publish to HTML and you could just use plain Mark Down and push it to a private github repo, then maybe use Wiki JS for your how to /lab docs
== Components/ Features ==
* Linux Laptop
* whois
* Taskwarrior Server (Need to dockerize this)
 
| VimWiki Server                                                                                  | Notes                                   |

| SSL certs setup, high level steps...                                                            | Need to automated SSL certs generation. |
| * Run openssl command to generate private key and CSR                                           |                                         |
| * Submit CSR to cert authority like namecheap                                                   |                                         |
| * Cert authority will have you prove that you own                                               |                                         |
| * the domain that the CSR is for.                                                               |                                         |
| * Once you prove you own the domain name, then the CSR                                          |                                         |
| * should issue you all the signed cert files you need.                                          |                                         |
| * In the case of NGINX, this comes down to 2 files that you need                                |                                         |
| * to combine into a single .cert file and put it where NGINX can                                |                                         |
| * find it, along with the private (.key) file that you generated.                               |                                         |
| * HTTPS over both the plain domain name and www should both work                                |                                         |
| * so long as you make an A record for the plain domain name (i.e. jkendall.dev)                 |                                         |
| * and a CNAME for the www name (i.e. a cname for www.jkendall.dev that points to jkendall.dev). |                                         |

|                                                                                                 |                                         |
